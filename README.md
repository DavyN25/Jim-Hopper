## Project Overview


- **Objective:**   
- **Approach:**   
- **Dataset:** 

## Final project presentation
The results from the analysis can be found in the presentation slides of the project:


## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3  
- Pandas (data manipulation)  
- NumPy (numerical operations)   
- Trello (project management)  
- GitHub (collaboration)



## Day 1 - Project Initiation & Data Selection
On Day 1 we focused selecting the database and analysing 

### 1. Introduction of the Project 

What we are, and what will do




### 2. Dataset Selection

We used the database fir Bike Sharing
This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between years 2011 and 2012 in Capital bikeshare system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/275/bike+sharing+dataset

It have 17.389 Instances and 13 Features, so we can test it on Regression tasks. 

**Dataset Features:**
- 

This dataset is useful for market research, such as identifying the best-performing genres and the highest revenue segments.

### 3. Data Transformation
The original dataset was almost clean, but we cleaned it using several techniques, then saved each function in a different .py file to apply later. 


### 4. Created a Kanban Board for Project Management Purposes on Trello.
We organized the tasks between before and after lunch for the whole week.

### 5. Created a Github Repository for the Project:
https://github.com/DavyN25/Jim-Hopper

We created the repository and defined the collaboration status for all group members. We use branch and merge techniques, so all files are always updated. We have practiced working collaboratively on the repository.

## Day 2 – 



## Day 3/4 – Conclusions & Assembling Report


### 1. Data Transformation



### 2. Analysis & Conclusions


### 3. Challenges in the Project



## Day 5 – Project Presentation
On Day 5 we presented our findings and pitched the business plan. 
We finish the final code, with legends about the code to fill best practises learnings. 



### 2. Final project presentation
